# AI Policy Chat

## Introduction
AI Policy Chat is a project focused on developing a conversational agent to assist with AI policy discussions using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Motivation
As AI advances, discussions around ethical, legal, and societal implications grow more complex. This project aims to leverage LLMs to provide informed, contextually relevant responses on AI policy.

## Objectives
- Fine-tune LLaMA-2 7B for AI policy questions.
- Experiment with prompt engineering techniques.
- Benchmark performance against baseline models.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Sourced from government sites, think tanks, and international organizations.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Experimented with various hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, etc.).
- **Prompt Engineering**: Implemented techniques like priming, control codes, and templates.

## Results
- Fine-tuned models showed improvements in metrics like BLEU and ROUGE.
- Prompt engineering techniques enhanced the quality and relevance of responses.

## Challenges
- Balancing model generalization with domain-specific fine-tuning.
- Addressing ethical considerations and biases in LLM outputs.

## Future Work
- Explore domain-specific fine-tuning strategies.
- Develop nuanced evaluation metrics.
- Investigate ethical implications further.
